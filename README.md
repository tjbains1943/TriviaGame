# TriviaGame

This is a trivia game about animals, but the category can be changed to anything. There are ten questions as the default, but this can also be modified. This is because an API is being used. To start the game, simply click on the start button. At the end of the questions, you will be notified of your score. The project was useful in learning to integrate timers with functions.
